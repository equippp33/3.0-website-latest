# 3.0 Labs — Production Website

Modern Vite + React 19 build of the 3.0 Labs site. **Identical visuals** to the original
static prototype — same CSS, same fonts, same animations, same section order — rebuilt on a
production-grade foundation with routing, code splitting, linting, and formatting.

## Stack

- **React 19** — functional components, native document metadata, `lazy` + `Suspense`
- **Vite 6** — dev server, HMR, production bundling, code splitting
- **React Router 7** — client-side routing, `Link` / `NavLink`
- **ESLint 9** (flat config) + **Prettier 3** — code quality
- **Vanilla CSS** — original `styles.css` + `pages.css` copied verbatim into `src/styles/`

## Contact form (EmailJS)

The Contact page form sends submissions directly to your inbox via
[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) — no backend, no serverless function.

### Setup

1. **Create a free EmailJS account** at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com).
2. **Connect a sender** under *Email Services* (Gmail, Outlook, custom SMTP — anything works). Note the **Service ID** (`service_xxxxxxx`).
3. **Create a template** under *Email Templates*. Paste this body (or design your own):

   ```text
   New brief from {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})

   Company:    {{company}}
   Role:       {{role}}
   Ideal start: {{start}}

   Brief:
   {{brief}}
   ```

   In the template settings:
   - **To Email:** `{{to_email}}`
   - **Reply To:** `{{reply_to}}`

   Note the **Template ID** (`template_xxxxxxx`).
4. **Account → General → Public Key** — copy it.
5. **Copy `.env.example` → `.env`** and paste your IDs:

   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL_TO=nithin@threepointolabs.com
   ```

6. **Restart `npm run dev`** — Vite only picks up env vars on boot.

### Deploying

Add the same four `VITE_*` variables to the Coolify service's build environment before
redeploying. They get baked into the bundle at build time, so changing them requires a new
deploy — not just a restart.

### Notes

- `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL_TO` is the destination address. If you skip it, the form falls back to `nithin@threepointolabs.com`.
- All `VITE_*` vars are exposed to the client by design — EmailJS's public key is *meant* to be public; it only allows sending against your template, not arbitrary access to your account.
- Free tier: 200 emails/month. Bump to a paid plan if you outgrow it.

## Deploy (Coolify)

Coolify builds the `Dockerfile` and runs `node server.js` on `PORT` (default 3000).
`server.js` is the whole production host — there's no nginx or platform config in front of it:

- serves the built `dist/`, with a 1-year immutable cache on `/assets/*` (Vite hashes those)
- falls back to `index.html` so direct loads of `/portfolio` work
- answers **404** for paths the router doesn't know, instead of quietly serving the homepage —
  the route list comes from the generated `sitemap.xml`, so it stays in sync with `App.jsx`
- **301**s retired URLs (`REDIRECTS`) and any non-canonical host to `CANONICAL_HOST`
- handles `POST /api/contact`

### Environment

| Variable | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT`, `HOSTNAME` | `server.js` | default `3000` / `0.0.0.0` |
| `CANONICAL_HOST` | `server.js` | default `threepointolabs.com`; subdomains get 301'd to it |
| `SES_USER`, `SES_PASSWORD`, `SES_REGION` | contact form | SMTP credentials |
| `SENDER_EMAIL`, `NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAIL` | contact form | from / to addresses |
| `DATABASE_URL` | contact form | Postgres connection string |
| `VITE_*` | build | baked into the bundle — build-time only |

### DNS

Both the apex and `www` must point at the app. `www` returning an error while the apex works
splits the site across two hosts in Google's index, which is what `CANONICAL_HOST` exists to
collapse — but the 301 can only fire if the request actually reaches the container.

## What changed technically

| Concern                       | Before                                            | After                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **React delivery**            | UMD via `unpkg.com/react@18.3.1`                  | npm `react@19`, bundled by Vite                       |
| **JSX transpile**             | `@babel/standalone` in the browser (slow)         | Vite + SWC build-time transform                       |
| **Module system**             | Globals on `window` (`Object.assign(window, …)`)  | ES modules with named exports + a `@/` path alias     |
| **Routing**                   | Multiple `.html` files, full page reloads         | React Router 7 SPA, code-split per-route              |
| **Code splitting**            | None — all JSX shipped together                   | `React.lazy` per page + manual `react` / `router` chunks |
| **SEO meta**                  | Static `<title>` in HTML only                     | Per-page `<Seo>`: title, description, canonical, og/twitter |
| **Build pipeline**            | None                                              | `npm run build` → minified, hashed, tree-shaken `dist/` |
| **Lint / format**             | None                                              | ESLint 9 flat config + Prettier                       |
| **Type-safety nets**          | `/* global */` comments                           | Explicit imports — no implicit globals                |

### What did **not** change

- Every CSS class name (verified)
- Every animation, keyframe, transition, hover behavior
- Every section's content, copy, layout, and order
- Every breakpoint and responsive rule
- Fonts: Space Grotesk, Inter Tight, JetBrains Mono, Instrument Serif
- All inline `<style>` blocks inside page components (Services nav, Services blocks, Team page,
  Portfolio page) — kept verbatim
- All SVG visuals, the PixelGradient hero composition, the case-study mocks

### Why this structure

- **`sections/` vs `shell/` vs `components/`** — keeps landing-only chrome (`Navbar`, `Hero`,
  etc.) apart from the shared chrome (`PageNavbar`, `PageFooter`, `PageCTA`) used by the four
  sub-pages. Tiny reusable atoms (`Arrow`, `Eyebrow`, `NodeBadge`, `ImgPlaceholder`,
  `PixelGradient`) live in `components/` with a barrel export so imports stay terse.
- **Pages own their inline styles** — the original prototype put a few large
  `<style>{`...`}</style>` blocks inside `services-page`, `team-page`, and `portfolio-page`. We
  preserved them in place instead of trying to factor them into the global stylesheet —
  this guarantees zero visual drift while still leaving the door open to extract them later.
- **Lazy routes** — each page is a separate chunk (`HomePage-[hash].js`, …) so the initial
  paint only ships the landing bundle.
- **No CSS-in-JS, no Tailwind** — explicitly out of scope; original `styles.css` and
  `pages.css` are imported once in `main.jsx` and untouched.

## Visual parity confirmation

The migration is a **lift-and-shift of behavior, not a redesign**:

1. CSS files were copied byte-for-byte (`styles.css`, `pages.css`).
2. Class names, `data-screen-label` markers, inline `style` props, and ARIA attributes
   were preserved exactly as written.
3. The `useReveal` hook (IntersectionObserver fade-ups) keeps the same threshold, rootMargin,
   and 1.2 s fallback as the original.
4. Each section component is a 1:1 port of its source — only the imports changed.

To verify after a build: run `npm run preview` and diff against the original `*.html` pages
opened directly in a browser.
